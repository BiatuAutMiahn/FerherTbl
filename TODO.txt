-Implement InfinityUI App

-Implement Training Account /w Guided Tutorial, include QR code for auto launch.
-Implement Static Bin Report
-Implement "This looks like %d(x%d). The Standard Quantity for this Product is %d, your count is for an Overflow\nBin, and your entry suggests %d Boxes with a Quantity that is equal to the number of Boxes times the\nStandard Quantity. In other words the paper on the pallet could be indicating %d Boxes@Total %d.\n\nWould you like to correct this count or leave it as entered?\nCorrect/Keep [C/k]:"
-Implement Default Bin Locations on last count field for each product (static only)
-Implement Default Quantity on last count line
-Implement backport for previous date's counts (for reference based counts)
-Implement table display switch (Product Number Layout <-> Bin Location Layout)
-Implement admin request
-Implement admin meta management
-Move MyTables to Main

-Implement Assignment Preference (Counter Bias)
-Implement State Recovery on crash, (Notify Admin, Await Admin Ack or restart, upon restart for User-Identified session, auto login, goto last prompt, ie; MyTables,Prod)
-Implement Overflow Entropy Tracking for Table Assignments (Difficulty is based on product bin randomness, ie a table has product with very inconsistent bin locations)
  -Iterate through each product in totals, +1 point for each product, +1 point for each bin location for that product.
  -+1 for bin inconsistency over 4 day rolling period.
  -Average points by number of products in table.
  -Rank tables based on number of products, with difficulty bias.
